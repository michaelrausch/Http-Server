# Http Server

This is a simple toy HTTP server. It will serve HTML files, along with other resources from the same directory.

## Building and running

 * Make sure *build-essential* is installed
 * Build the server using make, and then run the server.
 * Place the content in the same directory as the server.
 * Access the content on http://localhost:8082, or whatever port is specified in WS_PORT in main.c
